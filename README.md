## Description

Neon Engine is a modular, high-performance game engine written in C++.
It leverages the power of existing open source libraries while maintaining a clean,
extensible architecture.

What started as a hobby engine, the goal is for the engine to support multiple platforms
and provide intuitive tools for creating interactive experiences without sacrificing low-level control.
Neon Engine aims to balance flexibility with simplicity, making game development accessible
while allowing for advanced customization.
